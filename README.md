Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up the backend of your application. By following these steps, you'll be able to initialize the backend, manage dependencies, and access the API documentation.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
Python and pip: Install Python and pip by following the instructions on the https://www.python.org/downloads/

Installation

1. Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:
		git clone https://github.com/denishalimajj/DispoBackend.git
2. Navigate to the Directory: Move into the project's root directory:
	cd DispoBackend

3. Install Dependencies: Use pip to install the required Python dependencies from the requirements.txt file:
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Configuration


The backend might require configuration based on your specific project needs. Ensure to:
1. Environment Variables: If necessary, set up environment variables to store sensitive data such as API keys or database credentials.
2. Configuration Files: Check if there are any configuration files (e.g., .env) that you need to customize for your environment.


Starting the Backend

To start the backend server, execute the following command:
	uvicorn app.main:app –reload
This command utilizes Uvicorn to launch the application. The --reload flag enables auto-reloading upon code changes, which is beneficial during development.

Accessing the API Documentation

After successfully starting the application, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/docs. This URL provides access to the automatically generated API documentation. You can explore and interact with the API endpoints using this interface.

Troubleshooting

Error Messages: If you encounter any errors during installation or startup, carefully read the error messages. They often contain valuable information about the issue.
Configuration Issues: If the server fails to start, double-check your configurations and ensure environment variables are set correctly.

Conclusion

You have successfully set up and launched the backend of your application! This guide covered installation, configuration, and starting the backend server. Moving forward, you can expand your application's functionality by adding routes, controllers, and additional features.
